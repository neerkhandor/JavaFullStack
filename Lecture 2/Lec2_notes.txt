ek form se dusre form mein convert hone ko hi mai compilarion bolta hu
mein isko translator bhi bol sakta hu
translator is used to convert from one format to another format
Three types of translator in Java
1.Interpreter -> if suppose line no 10 and line no 20 has error
interpreter line by line format change karta hai 
line by line wo change .class file mein convert karta hai
(line by line top to bottom code check karega and convert into .class file)
process ruk jaayega and aage run hi nahi karega
2.Compiler -> At one jo kar raha hai wo hota hai Compiler
compiler saara code compile karta hai and baadme error dikhata hai 
3.Assembler -> there are microprocessors udhar hoga Assembler
ek format se dusre format mein convert karne ka kaam karta hai
java mein interpreter and compiler dono use hota hai
javac ko execute jvm karta hai
jvm kaise chalta hai wo jaana is necessary
JVM Architecture
1.Class Loader sub system -> .class file ko load karta hai into jvm this is known as Loader
2.method area -> class code will be stored here
3.heap area -> object will be stored in heap area
4.java stack -> jo method execute hoti hai uski info will be stored here
5.pc register -> it will maintain next line info to execute
6.native stack -> it will maintain non-java code execution info
7.execution(interpreter) -> it is responsible to execute the program and provide o/p
8.native interface -> it will load native lib into jvm
9.native library -> it will 
(native matlab ye java ki chize nahi hai kisi aur language mein likhi hai)
library is collection of apis,classes,interface
interface is simlpe component in java
native vs non-native
there are certain functionality that we want from other language and not written in java to wo java ke liye native code hogaya
