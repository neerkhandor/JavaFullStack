Java Features
1.simple
2.paltform independent
java code(source code) ki file ko jab compile karnege to .class file generate hoti hai
ye .class file ko hi byte code kehte hai
javac ye command hai to compile the .java file and provide us with .class file
abhi tak code koi platform independent nahi hai 
but agar mere paas .class file hai to jvm kya karegi usko run karegi and this .class file is 
platform independent
jaisi jvm chal jata hai waise mujhe output mil jata hai
run and execute is same thing 
java code(src code) ko .class mein convert using javac (compile)  -> compilation
and when byte code aa gaya then when we use jvm to run using java command -> execution
3.Java is robust(v.powerful)
like automatic memory management wo jvm khudbakhud kar leta hai
like exception handling(self healing capacity)
4.oops
5.secure

in C language c->objCode->o/p
but this objCode can be attacked 
.class file cannot be attacked by anyone therefore it is safe
i installed jdk in that i got 2 folder one of jdk and other of jre
### interview question
difference between jdk and jre
jdk is set of tools to develop a program(like syntax)
jre gives us platform to execute program
jvm hota hai wo hota hai jre ke andar
os uses system variables 
ide gives auto suggestion error pehle se dikha deta hai and syntax bhi pata chalti hai
while compiling write javac fileName.java
har ek file mein sirf ek class hi public hoti hai
entry point jaha se code chalega wo main method hota hai
.class file jvm ko dena hai to ham java className

jab hame compile kar liya baadme while executing we have to write className not necessarily
fileName bcoz once .class file is created then it has nothing to do with original .java file
in java you have to write everything inside a class 
there are three cases
case 1 -> you have same file name and class name then no issue
case 2 -> you have different filename and class name but you have not mentioned public then you have to execute using className
if you execute using file name then it will give you an error
case 3 -> you have different filename and class name but you have mentioned public then it will give you error bcoz if you meintion public then your 
class name have to be same as fileName
